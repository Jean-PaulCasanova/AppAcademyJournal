Wednesday, November 20, 2024:  Today I continued readings on Binary trees, Depth first & breadth first searches, 
aswell as pre-, in-, & post- order traversals.
All in all it seems to be pretty interesting although, I will need to revisit enqueing/ dequeing and stacks.
With a practice problem right around the corner, I am excited to attempt them on time!
