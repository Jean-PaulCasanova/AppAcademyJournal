daily log of my studies

11/23- It's a beautiful saturday here in Miami, FL and after a nice breakfast followed by a bike ride, i sit down at my computer to 
pick up where i left off on sorting practce.
So far "out of place" insertion  was indeed a breeze (as expected,)
And "in place" insertion, although just slightly more advanced, was simple enough after i got my brain greased up.
Although I may have some questions regarding  the 'divider' and 'temp' variables that the material had us set up.
Now on to the next...
